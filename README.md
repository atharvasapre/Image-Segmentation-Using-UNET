# Semantic Segmentation with Advanced Deep Learning Models

## Overview
This project aims to enhance the accuracy of semantic segmentation tasks using a variety of deep learning models, including FCN, UNET, RA-UNet, Unet-ASPP, and Swin-Unet. Targeting applications in medical image analysis, autonomous driving, and video surveillance, it explores the effectiveness of these models in improving pixel-wise labeling accuracy.

## Models Overview
- **FCN (Fully Convolutional Networks):** Extends CNNs for pixel-wise segmentation.
- **UNET:** Utilizes an encoder-decoder architecture with skip connections for biomedical image segmentation.
- **RA-UNet:** Integrates attention mechanisms with UNET for refined feature focusing.
- **Unet-ASPP:** Incorporates atrous spatial pyramid pooling with UNET to capture multi-scale context.
- **Swin-Unet:** Combines Swin Transformer with UNET architecture for enhanced segmentation.

## Dataset
The CityScapes Image Pairs Dataset was used for training and evaluation, consisting of urban street scenes with detailed pixel-level annotations.

## Results
